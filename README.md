# Example Showing Nested Aux Routes

See `app-routing.module.ts`.

- Run `ng serve` and open `http://localhost:4200`.
- You will see an application with a few nested outlets. The main outlet is in green. The aux outlet is light blue.
- The aux outlet has another outlet.
- You will see some values displayed--one from the aux route, and the other one from its child.
- Click on a bunch of links to see the values change.
